# Route Switching Guide

## Quick Switch Commands

### Enable Modular Routes at /api/*
```bash
./switch-to-modular.sh on
# Restart server to apply changes
```

### Return to Legacy Routes at /api/*
```bash
./switch-to-modular.sh off
# Restart server to apply changes
```

## Manual Environment Variable Control

Set in `.env` file:
```bash
# Use modular routes at /api/*
USE_MODULAR_ROUTES=true

# Use legacy routes at /api/*
USE_MODULAR_ROUTES=false
```

## Current State Verification

Test which system is active:
```bash
# This will show different response formats
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health

# Legacy format: {"status":"ok","message":"Server is running","timestamp":"..."}
# Modular format: {"success":true,"data":{"status":"ok",...},"message":"...","timestamp":"..."}
```

## Benefits of Modular Routes

1. **Standardized Responses**: All endpoints return consistent success/error formats
2. **Better Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and detailed error messages
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Request performance metrics and detailed logging
4. **Improved Authentication**: Consistent JWT validation across all endpoints
5. **Maintainable Code**: Small, focused route modules instead of 12,775-line monolith

## Zero-Downtime Testing

Your frontend continues working without any code changes. The modular system handles all existing `/api/*` endpoints with improved architecture while maintaining full backward compatibility.
