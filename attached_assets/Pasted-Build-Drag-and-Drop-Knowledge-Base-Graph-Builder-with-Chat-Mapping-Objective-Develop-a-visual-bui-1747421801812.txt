Build Drag-and-Drop Knowledge Base Graph Builder with Chat Mapping
🟦 Objective
Develop a visual builder where users can:
Create a seperate page in the app
Create knowledge base nodes, each acting as a container for multiple documents

Upload and manage documents within each node

Connect nodes to a chat widget, so the AI chat experience uses only the mapped node’s content

Visually represent relationships between knowledge and conversations (mind-mapping style)

🧩 Core Functional Requirements
1. Node-Based Visual Interface
Use a library like React Flow to build a drag-and-drop canvas

Each node represents a knowledge base container:

Title of the knowledge base

Document count or labels

Drag to reposition

Nodes can be connected to:

Other knowledge nodes (for future linking)

A chat widget node (to simulate agent binding)

✅ Support zoom, pan, selection, and snapping

2. Node Data Structure
Each knowledge base node should store:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "node_kb_sales_docs",
  "name": "Sales Documents",
  "documents": [
    { "docId": "doc1", "name": "Pricing Guide", "content": "..." },
    { "docId": "doc2", "name": "Sales Playbook", "content": "..." }
  ]
}
Allow document upload, edit, delete within the node's side panel

Save each node and its documents in a backend or local store

✅ Use file or text input for docs

3. Mapping Knowledge Base to Chat Widget
Add a chat widget node to the canvas

Allow users to draw a connection from any knowledge base node to the chat widget

When connected, the chat widget uses that knowledge base’s documents as the context (RAG style)

✅ On connect:

Store knowledgeBaseId reference inside the chat widget node:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "chat_node_1",
  "type": "chat_widget",
  "linkedKnowledgeBase": "node_kb_sales_docs"
}
✅ Update the chat behavior to:

Load and query only the connected node’s documents

Fallback if no node is connected

4. Chat Widget Integration
Embed a live chat widget preview on the canvas or sidebar

When user types a message:

Pass it through your existing agent API

Use the connected knowledge base documents as the context or knowledgeBaseIds

✅ Ensure confidence threshold, fallback message, and rules still apply

🗂️ Suggested File & Component Structure
bash
Copy
Edit
/knowledgeflow
  └── Canvas.jsx              → React Flow implementation
  └── KnowledgeNode.jsx       → Knowledge base node UI
  └── ChatWidgetNode.jsx      → Chat widget preview and config
  └── NodeSidebar.jsx         → Document upload/edit panel
  └── nodeStore.js            → Save/load nodes and mappings
💾 Backend Tasks
Prompt Replit Agent to:

Create endpoints:

POST /knowledgebase/:nodeId/document (add doc)

DELETE /knowledgebase/:nodeId/document/:docId

GET /knowledgebase/:nodeId (get all docs in a node)

Store each node + docs using Replit DB or file system

🔐 Auth & Security
Only allow node and document management by the node creator

Validate chat queries are using allowed nodes for that user

🌐 Behavior & Preferences
Chat behavior dynamically switches based on connected knowledge base

If multiple nodes connect to one chat widget, allow toggling or merging logic

Replit Agent interaction: English

Interface: English

Support multilingual documents for global use cases

✅ Summary
You’re building a visual, intuitive mind-mapping tool that connects knowledge containers to conversational AI agents. This enhances control, reusability, and insight over how AI behaves per knowledge source.
