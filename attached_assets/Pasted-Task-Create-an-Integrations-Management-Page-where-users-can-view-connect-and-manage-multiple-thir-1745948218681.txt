Task:
Create an Integrations Management Page where users can view, connect, and manage multiple third-party integrations for different use cases inside BeyondAsk.

ðŸ›  Core Requirements
1. Integrations Page UI
Add a new "Integrations" section/page in the dashboard.

Display a list or grid view of available integrations.

Each integration should show:

Logo

Name

Short description (use case)

Connect/Setup button (if not connected)

Manage/Settings button (if already connected)

2. Available Integrations (Initial List)
Integrations to be listed:


Integration	Purpose
SMTP	Send transactional emails (e.g., OTPs, notifications)
Slack	Push chat updates or contact submissions to Slack channels
Zapier	Automate workflows (e.g., send contacts to CRM)
WordPress	Embed BeyondAsk widgets easily into WordPress sites
RSS Feed	Pull knowledgebase updates automatically
Sharepoint	Pull knowledgebase updates automatically

3. Connection Behavior
âœ… Allow users to connect and manage multiple integrations simultaneously without conflict.

âœ… Allow multiple instances for certain integrations where appropriate:

Slack â†’ connect to different workspaces/channels.

Zapier â†’ multiple zaps/workflows.

RSS Feed â†’ multiple RSS sources.

SMTP usually supports one active configuration at a time (but allow updating it easily).

4. Basic Setup Flow
Clicking Connect/Setup:

Open a configuration modal (form) or redirect to OAuth authentication (e.g., Slack, Zapier).

Save integration settings securely (e.g., SMTP credentials, Slack OAuth tokens).

5. Manage/Settings for Each Integration
After connecting:

List all active connections.

Allow viewing, editing, or disconnecting each integration instance individually.

Show integration status (Connected / Not Connected).

6. Extensibility
Design the integrations system modularly:

Easily add new integrations later without a full redesign.

Store integrations in a flexible database structure (per user or per AI agent if necessary).

ðŸš€ Stretch Goals (Optional / Phase 2)
Status indicators for each connection (Active, Disconnected, Error).

Integration-specific logs (e.g., SMTP send logs, Slack message logs).

Auto-pull scheduling for RSS feeds (e.g., every 30 minutes, 1 hour).

Error Handling: Retry failed connections or alert user on failure.

ðŸ”’ Security Notes
Encrypt sensitive data (SMTP passwords, API keys, OAuth tokens) in the database.

Validate user permissions before allowing access to integration management.

Ensure OAuth flows (Slack, Zapier) are securely implemented and tokens refreshed as needed.
