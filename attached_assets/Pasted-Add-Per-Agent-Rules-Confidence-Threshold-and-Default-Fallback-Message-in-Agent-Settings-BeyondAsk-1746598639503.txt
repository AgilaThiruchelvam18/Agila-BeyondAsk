Add Per-Agent Rules, Confidence Threshold, and Default Fallback Message in Agent Settings (BeyondAsk)
Task:
Enhance the AI Agent settings page to allow configuration of custom behavioral rules, confidence threshold, and a default fallback message for each individual agent.

📋 Feature 1: Custom Rules Per Agent
✅ UI & UX
Add a "Rules for this Agent" section to the AI Agent settings page.

Allow admins to:

Add multiple free-text rules

Edit or delete rules

Display rules in a list or card format

✅ Functionality
Store rules in the agent’s config.

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "rules": [
    "Only respond based on uploaded knowledgebase content.",
    "Avoid hallucinations or fictional data."
  ]
}
Inject rules into the AI prompt system for that agent.

These should appear at the top of the AI system context (system prompt).

Each agent uses only its own rules during inference.

📋 Feature 2: Confidence Threshold Score Per Agent
✅ UI & UX
Add a "Confidence Threshold" slider or numeric input in the agent settings.

Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (e.g., 0.75)

Tooltip or helper text:
"If the AI’s confidence falls below this threshold, fallback behavior will be triggered (e.g., ask for clarification or show fallback message).”

✅ Functionality
Save this value in the agent config:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "confidenceThreshold": 0.75
}
During inference:

If the AI response or intent classification returns a confidence score below this value:

Show the default fallback message like:
“I’m not confident enough to answer that accurately. Could you rephrase or try again?”

📋 Feature 3: Default Fallback Message Configuration
✅ UI & UX
Add a "Default Fallback Message" input field (or textarea) in the agent settings page.

This will allow admins to configure a message to be shown when the AI is unsure or unable to provide a meaningful response.

Example of fallback messages:

“I’m not confident enough to answer that. Could you rephrase?”

“Sorry, I’m unable to help with that right now. Please try again later.”

✅ Functionality
Save this fallback message in the agent configuration:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "fallbackMessage": "Sorry, I’m unable to help with that right now. Please try again later."
}
If confidence threshold is not met or if the AI is unable to generate a proper response, this fallback message will be shown to the user instead.

🔐 Security & Validation
Limit max rules per agent (e.g., 10)

Limit rule length (e.g., 200 characters each)

Ensure confidence threshold is a valid number between 0.0 and 1.0

Validate the fallback message length (e.g., 500 characters max)
