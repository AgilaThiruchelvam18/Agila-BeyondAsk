ðŸ”§ Immediate Bug Fix
âœ… 1. Fix: Logged-in User Not Showing in Members List
The currently logged-in user (team owner or member) is not appearing in the team members list view.

Ensure the user who created the team is:

Automatically included as a member (with "Admin" role).

Displayed correctly in the members UI.

Also verify if team members are loaded via a teamâ€“user relation or lookup table (e.g., team_members).

ðŸ“‹ Feature Audit â€” Please Confirm or Implement
A. âœ… Flexible Role Management
Confirm if roles are defined in a scalable way (e.g., stored in a roles table or enum).

If not implemented:

Refactor role logic so new roles can be added later without major changes.

B. âœ… Fine-Grained Permissions
Confirm if permissions are modular and per-feature/module.

If not:

Define a structure for mapping roles to module-level permissions (e.g., "Can Edit Knowledgebase").

C. âœ… Activity Logs (Audit Trail)
Confirm if the following are being tracked:

Team member invites/removals

KB/Agent edits

If not:

Implement a simple audit log model and create a basic UI (viewable by Admins only).

D. âœ… Pending Invitation Management
Confirm the following:

Can Admins cancel invites?

Can they see the invite expiration time?

Can they track acceptance or expiry?

If not:

Implement full lifecycle tracking for invitations.

E. âœ… Notifications
Confirm if the following email notifications are sent:

When a team member joins

When an invite is about to expire

When a userâ€™s role changes

If not:

Implement event-based email triggers for each of these scenarios.

F. âœ… User Profiles
Confirm if users can:

Update their name, email (with verification), and password

Upload a profile picture

If not:

Create a profile settings page with editable fields and secure update flows.

G. âœ… Multi-Organization Support (Advanced)
Confirm if a single user can belong to multiple teams with different roles.

If not:

Ensure the DB schema supports many-to-many userâ€“team relationships for future use.

ðŸ”’ Security Checklist
Confirm the following:

Invite tokens are secure (JWT or cryptographically random strings with expiry).

Invite links are protected from brute-force access.

All role and permission checks are enforced server-side (not just hidden in the UI).

ðŸ§ª Post-Implementation QA Checklist (Optional but Recommended)
 Can see the logged-in user in team member list

 Can invite a new user and cancel/resend the invite

 Can see audit log of recent actions

 Role-based permissions enforced on each module

 Email notifications triggered for join/expiry/role changes

 User profile settings page is functional
