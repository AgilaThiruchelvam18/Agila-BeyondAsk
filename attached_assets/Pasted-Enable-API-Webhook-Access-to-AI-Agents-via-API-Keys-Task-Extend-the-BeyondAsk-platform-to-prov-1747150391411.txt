Enable API & Webhook Access to AI Agents via API Keys
🟦 Task:
Extend the BeyondAsk platform to provide secure API access to AI agents through user-generated API keys and expose individual webhook endpoints per agent to support integrations with tools like Zapier, n8n, and custom webhooks.

🔐 Authentication
Implement an API key management system per user or team.

Users must be able to:

Generate and label API keys

Revoke or regenerate keys

Monitor API usage (optional)

API keys must be securely hashed and stored

Keys must be passed via Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY> in requests

🌐 Agent Interaction API (Core Endpoint)

🛡️ Security & Rate Limiting
Rate limit per API key (configurable)

Prevent one team from accessing another’s agents

Log all requests with timestamps and originating IPs (optional)

📊 Optional Analytics (Future Feature)
