(Optionally) filter or search by role, category, or tags

{
  "id": "facebook_ad_maker",
  "name": "Facebook Ad Maker",
  "description": "Generates short, benefit-focused Facebook ads tailored for SaaS products.",
  "promptTemplate": "...",
  "rules": ["..."],
  "confidenceThreshold": 0.8,
  "fallbackMessage": "...",
  "knowledgeBaseIds": [],
  "allowContinuousGeneration": false,
  "enableConversationMemory": false,
  "isPredefined": true,
  "tags": ["Marketing", "Ads"],
  "icon": "📣"  // Optional emoji or asset reference
}
🧠 User Flow
User opens "Explore AI Agents" from the dashboard or sidebar.

Predefined agents are displayed as cards in a grid or list.

User clicks “Use This Agent” on a card.

A modal lets them:

Review the full prompt and rules

Optionally rename the agent

On confirm:

A copy of the predefined agent is created under the user’s workspace

knowledgeBaseIds remains empty for user to configure later

🧑‍🎨 Interface Design Notes
Style should match your existing UI (professional, user-friendly, dark mode compatible)

Reuse your agent creation components if possible for the preview/edit modal

If you want inspiration:

Think “Notion template gallery” or “Zapier automation starter list”

🔐 Permissions
Users cannot edit predefined agents directly

They only create a copy for customization

Optional: Admin-only toggle to manage predefined agents
