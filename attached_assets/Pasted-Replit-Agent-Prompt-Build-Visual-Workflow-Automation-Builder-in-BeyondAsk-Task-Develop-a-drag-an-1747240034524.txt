Replit Agent Prompt: Build Visual Workflow Automation Builder in BeyondAsk
üü¶ Task
Develop a drag-and-drop, no-code workflow automation builder for the BeyondAsk platform. Users should be able to:

Define triggers

Select and configure AI agents

Route the output to integrations (APIs, webhooks, third-party services)

Save and run workflows on demand or in response to real-time events

This feature should work similarly to Zapier or n8n.

üéØ Core Capabilities
1. Visual Builder Interface
Drag-and-drop or flowchart-based builder UI

Nodes represent:

Triggers

Actions (AI agent calls)

Integrations (e.g., SendGrid, webhook, Slack)

Users can connect nodes to form a logic path

Display input/output for each node inline for clarity

2. Workflow Triggers
Support the following trigger types:

Manual trigger (for testing/debugging)

Webhook trigger (auto-generated URL to start workflow)

Schedule trigger (e.g., daily at 9AM)

API trigger (via internal event or 3rd-party hook)

Example Trigger:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "type": "webhook",
  "url": "https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/workflows/trigger/:workflowId"
}
3. Agent Node (AI Action)
Let users select from their own or predefined agents

Provide inputs for:

Prompt/message template

Agent ID

Dynamic inputs (e.g., userName, userEmail)

Support memory and metadata handling if enabled

Node runs /api/v1/agents/:agentId/chat under the hood

4. Target Integrations
Support output targets such as:

Webhook (POST response to URL)

Email (via SendGrid)

Slack message

Airtable or Google Sheets row update

JSON return for API response

Each integration node should allow mapping of fields from previous nodes.

5. Dynamic Variables & Mapping
Allow users to map outputs from one node to inputs in the next

Example: Use AI-generated email as the body in a SendGrid email node

üìÅ Workflow Metadata & Storage
Store workflows as JSON configs in the database

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "welcome_email_flow",
  "name": "Welcome Email Generator",
  "nodes": [ ... ],
  "connections": [ ... ],
  "trigger": { "type": "webhook", "url": "..." },
  "createdBy": "user123"
}
Include:

Workflow name and description

List of nodes (with type, settings)

Connections (edges)

Status (active, draft, paused)

‚öôÔ∏è Execution Engine
On trigger, execute nodes in sequence based on connections

Pass output from one node to the next

Include error handling and status reporting

Enable testing mode to preview outputs step-by-step

üõ°Ô∏è Security
Only allow users to run workflows they created

Protect webhooks using secret tokens or API key validation

Rate-limit executions per user/team

üåê Language & Preferences
Replit Agent Language: English

Interface Language: English

Output from AI agents may support multilingual content depending on input

‚úÖ Summary of Goals
This feature will allow your users to:

Automate business and marketing tasks

Build dynamic workflows like:

"When webhook is triggered ‚Üí Generate email via agent ‚Üí Send with SendGrid"

"Every Monday ‚Üí Summarize meeting notes ‚Üí Post to Slack"

Integrate AI into their tools and data pipelines without code
