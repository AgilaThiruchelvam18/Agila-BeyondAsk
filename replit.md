# BeyondAsk - AI-Powered Knowledge Management Platform

## Overview

BeyondAsk is an advanced AI-powered knowledge management and workflow automation platform that enables intelligent content synthesis through visual workflow design. The platform combines multiple knowledge sources with AI-powered synthesis to create compelling content through a drag-and-drop interface.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture Pattern
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript, Vite build system
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, modular route architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Auth0 with JWT token validation
- **AI Services**: Multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral)
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone for embeddings and semantic search

### Modular Route Architecture
The application uses a sophisticated modular routing system that provides both legacy compatibility and modern organization:

```
server/routes/
├── index.ts                    # Central route registration
├── health-routes.ts           # System health monitoring
├── agent-routes.ts            # AI agent management
├── document-routes.ts         # Document processing & storage
├── knowledge-base-routes.ts   # Knowledge base CRUD
├── conversation-routes.ts     # Chat lifecycle management
├── team-routes.ts            # Team collaboration
├── user-routes.ts            # User management
└── [additional domains...]
```

### Database Architecture
The system uses a domain-driven adapter pattern for database operations:

```
server/adapters/
├── base-adapter.ts           # Common utilities and error handling
├── user-adapter.ts           # User domain operations
├── agent-adapter.ts          # Agent domain operations
├── document-adapter.ts       # Document domain operations
└── [domain-specific adapters...]
```

## Key Components
