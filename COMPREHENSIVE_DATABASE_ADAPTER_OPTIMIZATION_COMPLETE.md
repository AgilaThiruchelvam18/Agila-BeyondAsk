# Comprehensive Database Adapter Optimization - PROJECT COMPLETE

## Executive Summary
Successfully completed the comprehensive optimization of the PostgreSQL database adapter layer, transforming a massive 4,800+ line monolithic adapter into a clean, modular, zero-duplication architecture across all 9 domains.

## Project Overview
